A todo list classified in different projects implemented with vanilla JavaScript. Each list item can have a title, a description, notes, a priority and a checklist and it's also associated with a date. Items are assigned different colors depending on their priority.

You can see items by project as well as all the items that are due today by clicking on the 'Today' button on the header.

Your list can also be saved and accessed on different browsers and environments if you sign in with Google.
